**Kasaysayan ng San Jose: Preserving a Philippine Historical Heritage** is a project to preserve and document over 250 years of vital demographic and other historical records held at the [Church of Saint Joseph, the Patriarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph_the_Patriarch_Church_(Batangas)) in [San Jose, Batangas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_Batangas), in the Philippines.

The baptism, marriage, and burial records date back to the parish's founding in 1767. We believe they are among the few surviving sets of Filipino parish records of that age. In addition, there are hundreds of pages of Ecclesiastical Decrees (Decretos Eclesiasticos) and inventory lists of church properties (Libros de Inventario) dating back to the 1850s. It is interesting to note that one of the latter documents was [signed in February 1868 by Fr. Jose Burgos](/img/burgos.jpg), whose execution by the Spanish colonial authorities almost exactly four years later, along with two other Filipino priests ("Gomburza"), sparked the Philippine revolt against Spain.  

These records are collected in bound volumes and are stored in a wooden cabinet in the church, but have not received any other conservation treatment over the centuries. Many of the volumes have already begun to deteriorate and are in need of immediate care and attention. If no intervention is done in time, these invaluable historical and cultural records will be irretrievably lost to future generations.

In our desire to preserve these records, we requested the assistance of the Philippine National Commission on Culture and the Arts (NCCA) in early 2018. In April 2018, an expert from the NCCA conducted a physical assessment of the San Jose archival records and subsequently issued a Technical Report describing the condition of the books and recommending specific courses of action. [Read more about the NCCA report here.](/blog/ncca-assessment-and-recommendations/)

We learned in December 2018 that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons or LDS) filmed/microfiched the San Jose ecclesiastical records in the mid-1970s when the late Rev. Father Lucio Aguilar, OSJ was parish priest. The LDS have since digitized these archival records and they are now available online at LDS Family History Centers, of which there are over 4,500 globally, including several in the Philippines. Thus, we have excluded digitization from the scope of the Kasaysayan project.

**Kasaysayan ng San Jose** is looking to bring together funding and conservation expertise, and adopt the recommendations of the NCCA to physically preserve this unique and irreplaceable piece of Filipino history. Our objectives are to:

- Secure conservation treatment for eight volumes in need of immediate attention;
- Fund a modern on-site storage system that would protect the volumes from further degradation and from risks such as fire and moisture; and
- Install a few computers with wi-fi capability onsite and, in partnership with the LDS, make the records available online to local researchers. (N.B.: We are presently in discussion with the LDS regarding the parish obtaining online access to the records.)
